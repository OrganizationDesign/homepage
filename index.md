## About
We introduce a public, hand-collected organizational-structure database covering 612 S&P 500 firms (1993–2020) with 198,221 executive-firm-year observations across 13,844 firm-years. Executive lists were manually extracted from annual reports, 10-K filings, and DEF 14A proxy statements, then titles were categorized into six managerial role groups and twelve hierarchical levels using fine-tuned large language models. The data are linkable to standard sources via CUSIP, GVKEY, and ticker, enabling longitudinal and cross-industry research on top-management team composition and firm structure.
